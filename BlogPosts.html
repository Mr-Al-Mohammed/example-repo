          a coastline of 50 kilometers. It contains 24 villages and towns, and has about 140 mosques and a number of historical landmarks, including the Al Khowdh Castle, the Jifnain, Al Rusayl, Al Kharus, Al Sileel, and Wadi Al Hayaa towers. In the past, it was called “Dama and Al Seeb” due to the flow of water. 
          Today, it is known as the “jewel of the capital” because of its comprehensive urban development that has taken place in recent years.</p>
